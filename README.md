# Meghplat - Your Career Growth Hub

Hey there! Welcome to Meghplat, my flagship project as a Full Stack Developer intern. This isn’t just a website—it’s a career ecosystem I’ve poured my heart into building. Think of it as a one-stop platform where people can level up their skills, explore opportunities, and get inspired. It’s got everything from online courses and workshops to career guidance, expert meetups, case studies, and blogs. I’ve deployed it on Netlify, and it’s fully live for you to check out!

## What’s Meghplat All About?

I designed Meghplat to solve a problem I’ve seen firsthand: Career growth can feel overwhelming. So, I built this site to bring together practical tools and resources in one place. Whether you’re here to learn coding through workshops, browse courses, read real-world case studies, or get advice from industry pros, Meghplat’s got your back. It’s my way of blending creativity with tech to make something useful—and I’m pretty proud of how it’s turned out.

## Key Features

- **Learning Hub**: Dive into courses and workshops tailored for tech enthusiasts.
- **Career Guidance**: Tips and tools to navigate your professional journey.
- **Expert Connect**: Virtual meetups with industry pros (because who doesn’t want insider advice?).
- **Case Studies & Blogs**: Real stories and insights to spark ideas.
- **Seamless Integration**: Sub-projects like Courses, Career, and Workshop flow into the main site.

## Tech Stack

Here’s what I used to bring Meghplat to life:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a sprinkle of React for dynamic vibes)
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express (keeps things smooth behind the scenes)
- **Deployment**: Netlify (fast, reliable, and my go-to)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub (where all the magic happens)
- **Extras**: Responsive design focusing on UX—because looks matter, but usability’s king.

## A Bit About Me

I’m Hariom Kabra, an intern who’s all about coding, problem-solving, and making tech accessible. Meghplat is my brainchild from my time as a Full Stack Developer—proof I can build something from scratch, deploy it, and tie it all together with sub-projects. I’ve loved tweaking every detail, from the front-end polish to the backend logic. Want to see more of my work? Hit me up on GitHub!

## Why This Matters

This project isn’t just code—it’s my take on helping people grow. I’ve handled everything from design to deployment, and linking up the sub-sites was a fun challenge. If you’re a recruiter or just curious, I hope Meghplat shows what I’m capable of. If you’ve got ideas to improve it, I’m all ears—collaboration’s my jam.

## Next Steps

I’m still tinkering with Meghplat, so expect more features down the line—maybe some interactive tools or extra content. Stick around!
